Now, let's go through the steps to test this program:

1. Compile the scanner and parser:
```
ocamlc -o scanner.byte scanner.mll
ocamlc -o parser.byte parser.mly
```

2. Compile the AST, pretty-printer, and tree runtime:
```
ocamlc -o ast.byte ast.ml
ocamlc -o prettyprint.byte prettyprint.ml
ocamlc -o tree.byte tree.ml
```

3. Test the TML file:
```
./parser.byte < tree.trml
```
This should output the parsed TML statements in the pretty-printed format.

4. Test the TRS file:
```
./tree.byte < tree.trs
```
This should execute the TRS statements and perform the forward and backward passes on the tree, checking for completeness and replacing the values.

5. Inspect the final state of the tree:
   - The root node `Tree` should have a forward value of `5` and a backward value of `50`.
   - The node `A` should have a forward value of `2` and a backward value of `18`.
   - The nodes `B` should have forward values of `3`, `4` and backward values of `19`, `21`.
   - The node `C` should have a forward value of `7` and a backward value of `28`.

You can add more test cases by modifying the `tree.trml` and `tree.trs` files, and then running the tests again. You can also add more comprehensive tests in a separate file, similar to the `test_prettyprint.ml` example provided earlier.

Here's a high-level overview of the program:

1. The `tree.trml` file defines the initial structure of the tree, including the root node, intermediate nodes, and their connections.
2. The `tree.trs` file defines the forward and backward pass operations on the tree:
   - The `create` statements define how to create child nodes from parent nodes during the forward pass.
   - The `eval` statements define how to update the backward values of parent nodes based on the values of their child nodes.
   - The `def` statement defines a helper function `sum` to aggregate the values of child nodes.
3. The program executes the forward and backward passes on the tree, checks for completeness, and then replaces the forward values with the backward values to prepare the tree for the next run.

You can use this example as a starting point to test and further develop the CamlTree language implementation.
